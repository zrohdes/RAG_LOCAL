Copypython --version



PyCharm IDE

Please raise a request with the Service Desk team for PyCharm installation
Reference: [Your organization's service desk ticket system reference]



Please ensure these installations are completed by [suggested deadline, e.g., "end of this week"]. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please don't hesitate to reach out to:

For Python: Software Center Support
For PyCharm: Service Desk Team

Once you have completed the installations, please reply to this email confirming your setup is ready.
Important Note: Having these tools installed is crucial for participating in our upcoming training sessions.
Looking forward to our training sessions!
